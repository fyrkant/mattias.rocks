I started running in 2019 because a doctor told me my resting heart rate was too high. I started running in 2020 because there was nowhere else to go. I started running in 2021 because I had forgotten why I stopped.

For the first few months I was terrible at it. I would go out at 6am thinking I'd run 5km and end up walking the last two, wheezing past dog-walkers who were too polite to say anything. My shins hurt. My lungs hurt. My pride hurt most.

The thing nobody tells you about running is that the first ten minutes are always bad. Always. Doesn't matter how fit you are, how long you've been doing it, what the weather is like. The first ten minutes are a negotiation between the part of your brain that said yes to this and the part of your body that wants to know why.

After ten minutes something shifts. The breathing evens out. The legs find a rhythm. Your brain stops filing complaints and starts, reluctantly, to deal with the situation.

I run by the water now, when I can. Early morning, before the tourists arrive. The city is different at that hour—emptier, cleaner, more honest. You see the people who actually live there: the woman who opens the bakery, the man who walks three dogs of different sizes, the cyclist who always nods.

I have had some of my best thoughts while running. I have also had some of my worst. But they pass faster out there, in the air, with your feet moving. That's the real reason I do it, I think. Not the heart rate.
