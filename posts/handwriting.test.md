My handwriting got worse when I started using computers full-time. This is not a controversial observation—it happens to most people—but the degree of degradation surprised me when I noticed it. I signed something at a post office in 2017 and the person behind the counter glanced at my signature and then looked at me and then looked back at the signature.

I started keeping a paper notebook in 2018. Not a journal exactly—I'm not consistent enough for that—but a place for thoughts that don't belong in a document yet. Shopping lists, half-formed ideas, things I'm trying to work out, quotes I want to keep. The handwriting, after a year, had improved noticeably. Not to the level it was at school, but livable.

There's a theory that the physical act of writing by hand engages memory differently than typing. I have no idea if this is true in any rigorous sense, but something about writing things down by hand does seem to lodge them differently. Whether that's the motor engagement or the slower pace or simply the ritual, I can't say.

The notebook on my desk right now has a coffee ring on the cover and a pen clipped to the back. The current page has a diagram I drew trying to think through a problem, a book title, and the phrase "not the same as not wanting." I have no memory of what that last one refers to.
