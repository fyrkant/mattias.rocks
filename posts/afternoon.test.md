The best hours are between two and four in the afternoon. This is personal, not universal—I know people who do their best work before anyone else is awake, and people for whom 10pm is when things become clear. But for me it's the early afternoon, when the morning urgency has lifted and the evening hasn't arrived to complicate things.

I try to protect those hours. Not always successfully—they're the hours most meetings are scheduled into, the hours of the "quick chat" and the "just catching up" and the thing that would have been better as an email. But when I get them, something happens.

I think it's the quality of attention. In the morning I'm running down a list. In the evening I'm tired. In the afternoon I can actually think, which is different from doing. Thinking requires a kind of idle running that doesn't fit well with most scheduled activity.

Some of the things I'm most glad I made started between two and four on a Tuesday in a quiet room. Not because those hours are magical but because I happened to have them and happened to use them. The luck is in having the time and knowing what to do with it.

I'm aware this is a privilege. Most people don't get to choose which hours they think in. I try not to waste mine.
