I used to think sleeping eight hours was for people with nothing important to do. I was wrong about this in the way you're wrong about things when you're young and running on adrenaline and haven't yet accumulated enough consequences.

The consequences accumulated. Around 31 I crashed in a way that wasn't dramatic—no breakdown, no hospital—just a long, grey flatness that lasted several months. A doctor asked me how much I was sleeping. I told her. She looked at me the way doctors look at you when the answer explains everything.

Sleep is the infrastructure everything else runs on. This is obvious and I knew it intellectually before I knew it the other way. The difference between intellectual knowledge and felt knowledge is that one of them changes your behavior.

I sleep eight hours now. Sometimes eight and a half. I do not take meetings before 9am. I have a bedtime, which is embarrassing to say out loud but there it is. My code is better. My patience is better. My tolerance for difficult conversations is better. Essentially every metric I can think of improved when I stopped treating sleep as something to be minimized.

The hard part was giving up the identity. The late nights had meant something. They had meant I was serious, committed, willing to sacrifice. It took me a while to understand that what I was sacrificing was mostly my ability to think clearly.
