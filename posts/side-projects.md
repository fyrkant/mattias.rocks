I have started approximately forty side projects. I have finished four. The ratio is not improving.

The ones that died are not failures exactly—they were experiments, and experiments that don't work are still experiments. I've learned from most of them: a new library, a different way of structuring something, that I don't actually enjoy working with certain tools as much as I thought I would. Useful information.

The four I finished taught me different things. That I could finish something, which I wasn't always sure of. That finishing is a skill separate from building, and requires a different set of decisions—what to cut, where the edge is, when done means done. That the thing I imagined at the start and the thing I ended with were never the same, and that was fine.

The ones I'm working on now have a different quality than the ones from five years ago. Less ambitious in scope. More honest about what I want from them. I don't start them thinking they'll become products or companies. I start them because I want to make a thing, or learn a thing, or solve a specific problem that bugs me.

The pressure to make side projects legible—to be able to explain them at a party, to have them lead somewhere—has diminished. Some of them are just for me. That's allowed.
