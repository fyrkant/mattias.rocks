I've deployed code at midnight more times than I'd like to admit. Not because midnight is the right time to deploy, but because that's when the fix is ready and the anxiety of waiting until morning is worse than the anxiety of doing it now.

There is a specific quality to the silence of a late-night deploy. Everyone else has gone to bed. The Slack channel is empty. It's just you, the terminal, and whatever you've built. The cursor blinks.

The first time I did it I was 24 and convinced I had broken everything. The site went down for six minutes while I watched the logs scroll with my heart rate doing something alarming. Then it came back up. Everything was fine. I sat very still for a while.

The last time I did it I was calm the whole way through. Not because I knew nothing would go wrong, but because I knew what to do if it did. The distance between those two nights is the distance between knowing things and having done things.

I still prefer to deploy in the morning, with coffee, when other people are around. But I don't dread the midnight ones anymore. There's something almost meditative about them. Just you and the logs and whatever you're shipping into the world.
