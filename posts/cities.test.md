Stockholm is the city I'm from, which means I see it in a way that is not quite seeing it. The way you stop noticing wallpaper in a room you've lived in for years. I know its streets and its light—that particular quality of winter light in November, low and silver—but I've lost the ability to be surprised by it.

London was where I stopped being young. I don't mean this negatively. It's just that London is a city where things happen and I was there while several of them happened to me, and when I left I was different. I miss the density of it, the sense of endless adjacency, the fact that almost anything you could want is a short tube ride away.

Tokyo I understood least and felt most at home in, somehow. The orderliness of it, the way public space is maintained as though everyone has tacitly agreed on a set of rules that nobody needs to state. The convenience stores at 2am selling hot food and beer and stationery. The vending machines everywhere. The politeness that isn't coldness.

I have a list of cities I want to spend real time in, not tourist time. Weeks, not days. You need weeks to start feeling the rhythm of a place. Days and you're just looking at it. I want to stop looking and start being in them, even briefly. Even knowing I'll leave.
