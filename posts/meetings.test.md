The worst meeting I've ever attended lasted four hours and produced no decisions. We were twelve people in a room that fit eight comfortably. The agenda was a slide deck that someone had clearly put together the night before. The coffee ran out at hour two. By hour three people were checking their phones openly.

The best meeting I've attended lasted eleven minutes. Four people. One problem, already described in a document everyone had read. We made a decision, assigned who was doing what, and dispersed. I thought about it afterward with something close to joy.

The difference between these meetings is not the stakes or the topic or the talent of the people in the room. It's whether someone knew what the meeting was for. A meeting with a clear purpose and a clear decision to be made can be short. A meeting without those things expands to fill whatever time was blocked.

I've gotten more willing to say what a meeting is for before I schedule it. Not aggressively, not as a policy, just as a habit. "I want to decide X" or "I need input on Y" or "we need to align on Z." One sentence. It filters out half the meetings because in the writing of it you realize the meeting isn't necessary.

Most things that feel like they need a meeting are solved faster by a document. I believe this strongly and act on it imperfectly, like most beliefs.
