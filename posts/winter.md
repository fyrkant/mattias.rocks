The dark months used to bother me more. In Sweden the winter is long and the light is genuinely scarce—December gives you maybe six hours of dim, low-angle sun if it's not overcast, which it usually is. When I was younger I felt it as a kind of pressure, a ceiling lowering.

I've come around on winter. Not in a performative way, not in the way people talk about hygge or whatever this year's word for cozy is. Just an actual shift in how I experience it.

Part of it is acceptance. Part of it is that I've found the things winter is good for: long evenings with good lighting, cooking that takes time, reading without the guilt of ignoring nicer weather. Projects that need sustained, uninterrupted hours.

Part of it is that summer is genuinely tiring. The pressure to be outside, to be in the light, to be doing things with the beautiful weather—it has a texture I find exhausting. Winter removes that pressure. There's nothing you're failing to enjoy. You're just inside, which is fine, which is allowed.

February is the hardest month still. But it ends, and when the light comes back it comes back fast—from six hours to sixteen over the course of about ten weeks—and there's something in that return that feels earned in a way the summer light in other climates never quite does.
