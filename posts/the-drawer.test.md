Every flat I've lived in has had a drawer. Not a specific drawer—just the one that accumulates. It's never the same drawer in any two flats, but it's always there: the drawer where things go when they need to go somewhere and you haven't decided where.

Dead batteries I'm not sure are dead. The Allen key from a piece of furniture assembled years ago in another country. A set of earplugs still in their case. A receipt I kept because I thought I might return something and then didn't. A pen that might still work. Three pens that don't. Something I bought at a hardware store whose purpose I'm now unsure of. A birthday card from someone with handwriting I can't identify.

I cleaned out the drawer when I moved last time and found, inside it, evidence of about five years of decisions deferred. Each object was a small failure of resolution. At the time I dropped it in the drawer, I must have thought I'd deal with it later. Later came.

I keep the drawer. I'm not sure I could function without it. There's something honest about having a designated space for things you haven't decided about. The alternative is making a decision about everything immediately, which sounds exhausting and probably produces worse decisions.

The drawer in my current flat is filling up again. There's a cable I don't recognize. I'm sure I'll know what it's for eventually.
