The one in Södermalm where the music was always too loud and the wifi password was the name of a Swedish poet I didn't recognize. I asked the barista to spell it. He did so without looking up from whatever he was doing. I worked there for three months, on and off, and never learned his name.

The one in London with the scaffolding outside that was there when I arrived and still there when I left eight months later. They sold oat milk before it was easy to find oat milk anywhere. The owner had a small dog that slept under the counter. I wrote a lot of bad code in that place and some of it is still in production somewhere.

The one in Tokyo that I found by accident, down a set of stairs below a bookshop, where nobody spoke English and I nobody spoke Japanese and somehow we managed fine. They had one table. I sat at it for four hours and ordered three coffees and felt, briefly, like I could live there.

The one near my flat now. I know all the regulars by sight. There's the woman who always has the same book open but seems to be looking past it. The man who types furiously and then stops and stares at the ceiling. The couple who come every Saturday and barely speak but seem happy. I am probably someone's category in their internal taxonomy. A man who sits alone and writes things and drinks americanos. True on all counts.
