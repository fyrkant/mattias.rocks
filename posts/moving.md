I've moved eleven times in my adult life. Five cities, three countries. Each time I've thought: this is the last time. Each time I've been wrong.

Packing is a kind of archaeology. You find things you forgot you owned, and the objects are embarrassing time capsules of who you were when you bought them. The book you were definitely going to read. The exercise equipment. The cables for devices you no longer have.

I've gotten efficient at it. I know how to pack a kitchen, how to wrap glasses in t-shirts, how to estimate how many boxes a room will take. I know to label the boxes with the room they're going to, not the room they came from. I know to keep a box of essentials separate—coffee maker, laptop, phone charger, at least one towel.

What I haven't gotten efficient at is the feeling of the last night in a place. Every flat I've lived in has had a last night where it stops being mine and becomes somewhere I'm staying temporarily until I leave. The familiar shapes of it are still there, but it doesn't hold me the same way.

The new place takes a few months to feel inhabited. You have to make some memories in it. You have to know where the light falls in the afternoon, where the drafts come from, which neighbors make noise and when. Then it starts to become somewhere you live.

I think I'm staying this time. But I thought that before.
