I started making bread in 2020, like most people who started making bread in 2020. The first few loaves were dense and sad. The fifth one was pretty good. By the tenth I understood what I was doing enough to start varying it deliberately rather than accidentally.

Bread is satisfying in a way that most things I do aren't, because you can eat the result. There's something primal and slightly ridiculous about making your own bread when you could just buy it, which is exactly why I like it.

The interesting thing about bread is how forgiving it is once you understand what you're actually doing. If your kitchen is cold, the dough rises slower—so give it more time. If your flour is different, the hydration needs to change. If you forgot about it for an hour, it's probably fine, maybe better. The bread is tolerant of imprecision in a way that accommodates a normal human life.

The part that's less forgiving is the oven. The oven you have matters more than almost anything else. Mine runs about 15 degrees hot, which took me a while to realize was why the tops were always darker than the insides had any right to expect.

I make a loaf most weekends now. My partner has requested that I do not get any more into it than I currently am, which I take to mean they are happy with the loaves as they are. Fair enough.
