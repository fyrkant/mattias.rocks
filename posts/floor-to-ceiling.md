It’s a picture of my wife standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling window at the art museum. The weather is the typical gray skies of September, ready to rain any minute but it’s holding up right now. She is 8 months pregnant and beaming in that way that you’ve read that pregnant women do but you probably don’t really understand until it’s your partner carrying your child. It’s something in her eyes? Or is it my eyes? I feel it in my heart, it’s melting.

Well anyway. 

I choose the picture, press the add button and send the email. “You’re going to be an uncle soon” is the title, no message.
