I used to read fast. Not speed-reading exactly, but I'd get through a novel in a few days, skimming the parts where nothing much happened, racing toward whatever was next. I finished a lot of books. I remembered approximately half of them.

Something changed around 35. Either I slowed down or I started noticing what I was missing when I didn't. I started re-reading paragraphs I liked, not because I hadn't understood them, but because I wanted to stay in them longer. I started underlining things. I started putting the book down to think.

I finish fewer books now. This bothered me at first—the same completionist anxiety that makes you feel bad about a backlog—until I reframed it. The goal was never the number of books. The goal was whatever I was getting from reading, which is a slightly different thing and takes more time.

The best books, read slowly, start to feel less like stories you're consuming and more like conversations you're having. You bring things to them and they give you things back. It takes a second reading of some books to realize what they were actually about.

I reread _Stoner_ last year. I'd read it fast the first time, thought it was good, moved on. The second time, slower, it was devastating. Same book. Different reader, I suppose.
