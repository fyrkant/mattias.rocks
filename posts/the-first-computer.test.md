My dad bought our first computer in 1994. It was a beige tower with a monitor the color of old teeth, and it lived in the corner of the living room where the bookshelf used to be. The bookshelf moved to the hallway. The computer stayed.

I was seven. My sister was nine. We were not allowed to touch it without permission.

The first game we played was a pinball game that came pre-installed. I don't remember the name, but I remember the sounds: the spring-loaded click of the launch, the bell-clatter of the bumpers, the soft thud when the ball fell through. My sister was better at it than me. She had more patience for the flippers.

Eventually my dad got us a game from a box at the market—something about building a civilization, placing roads and farms, watching small animated people go about their days. I would spend hours just watching them, not really playing, just observing the little world humming along without me.

There was a dial-up modem. The sound it made connecting to the internet was like something arguing with itself and losing. We got one hour of internet time per month to start. My dad would sit with us while we used it, not because he didn't trust us, but because he found it as strange and fascinating as we did.

I remember looking something up about dinosaurs—I had a phase—and the page took four minutes to load. A single picture of a triceratops skull, pixels resolving slowly from the top down, like a curtain being drawn. When it finished I felt like I'd received a letter from the future.

We have all of recorded human knowledge in our pockets now and I still think about that triceratops sometimes.
