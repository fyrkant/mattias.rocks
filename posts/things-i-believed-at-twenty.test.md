That confidence was something you either had or you didn't. That people who seemed at ease in rooms full of strangers were born that way, and the rest of us were just performing.

That the right job would feel obviously right, immediately, and if it didn't that meant it was the wrong job and I should keep looking.

That the people I admired had arrived at their lives through a series of good decisions, and if I made better decisions I would arrive somewhere good too.

That caring too much about things was embarrassing. That being effortlessly cool about everything was the goal. That visibly wanting something made you vulnerable in a bad way.

That I would know, by now, what I wanted to do with my life.

That adults had figured it out and were mostly just doing it. That the uncertainty I felt was a temporary condition that would resolve around 25.

That reading a lot of books would make me smart in a way people could sense, like a glow.

That productivity was a virtue and rest was its absence. That the best use of a Saturday was to be doing something with it.

That the friends I had at twenty would be my friends at forty, more or less, with some natural attrition. That the people who drifted away had drifted away for comprehensible reasons.

I was wrong about most of this. Some of it I'm still working through. The uncertainty did not resolve at 25. I'm not sure it resolves. But it changes shape, which turns out to be enough.
