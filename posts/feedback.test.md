The best feedback I've received was from a colleague who read something I'd written and said: "This is good but it's doing two things. Which thing do you want it to do?"

That was it. That was the feedback. Seven words of question and I sat with them for two days before I understood what the answer was, and once I understood the answer the revision was obvious and the thing was better.

The worst feedback I've received was a long, detailed list of every problem the reviewer had spotted, ordered in the sequence they'd encountered them, with no sense of which were important. I couldn't find the signal in it. I rewrote everything and made some of it worse.

Feedback is a skill on both sides. Giving it well requires knowing what the work is trying to do, which requires actually engaging with it, which requires time and attention that are genuinely scarce. Most feedback is given by people who did not have enough time. This produces feedback that notes surface problems and misses structural ones, or vice versa.

Receiving it well requires the ability to separate the observation from the proposed solution. Someone says "I don't understand this paragraph." The proposed solution is often implied—make it clearer, cut it, explain it more. The observation is just that they didn't understand. Sometimes the right response is a different solution entirely.

I'm better at receiving it than I used to be. I'm still working on giving it.
