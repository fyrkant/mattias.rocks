There's a person at every job who knows where everything is. Not officially—they're not the office manager or the department head. They just know. They know who to talk to to get X sorted. They know which process is documented and which one everyone just does differently. They know why the thing that seems wrong is actually done that way, because of something that happened in 2017.

These people are the actual infrastructure of organizations. When they leave, the company loses more institutional knowledge than any documentation could capture, because most of what they know was never written down. It couldn't be—it lives in the accumulated experience of being there, of having asked questions, of having noticed things.

I've been lucky to work alongside a few of these people. You can identify them quickly: they're the ones other people walk up to with specific questions and walk away from with answers. They're helpful without being martyrs about it. They understand the system well enough to know when to work within it and when to bend it.

I try to be more like them. Not the knowledge exactly—that takes years—but the practice of paying attention to how things actually work rather than how they're supposed to. The gap between those two things is where most interesting problems live.
