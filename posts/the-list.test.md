I keep a text file called `want-to-read.txt`. It has 340 entries. I add to it faster than I read. At my current pace I will finish it somewhere around 2041, assuming I stop adding things, which I won't.

I've made peace with this. The list is not a queue, it's a catalog of curiosity. It tells me what I found interesting on what day. The entries from 2018 look different from the ones from 2023, which look different from the ones from last month. You can trace something through the years if you squint.

I have similar lists for films, for albums, for places I want to go, for restaurants someone mentioned that I'd like to try. They are all longer than I can ever action. This used to bother me—the gap between wanting and doing, the incompleteness of it. Now it mostly doesn't.

There's a version of a good life where you whittle these lists down to zero. Inbox zero but for experience. I don't think I want that life. I'd rather have the list, long and accumulating, evidence of continued interest in the world.

The book I'm reading now isn't on the list. I found it by accident, which is how I find the best ones.
