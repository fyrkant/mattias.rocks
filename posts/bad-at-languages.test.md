I've been trying to learn Japanese for three years. My vocabulary is approximately 200 words. This is not going well.

The problem isn't motivation. I find the language genuinely beautiful—the way it compounds meaning, the different registers for different relationships, the writing systems that layer on top of each other like geological strata. I find it fascinating in the way you can find a mountain fascinating without necessarily wanting to climb it.

The problem is that I am, constitutionally, bad at learning languages. I took German for four years in school and left being able to order a beer and apologize. I studied French briefly in my twenties and got as far as talking about the weather. My Swedish, which should be native by all rights, developed a strange accent somewhere in my teenage years that still surfaces occasionally like a bad habit.

I use an app every day. I have a textbook with increasingly anxious annotations in the margins. I watch Japanese cooking videos with subtitles, which means I mostly learn words for dashi and fermentation and please wait while the broth reduces.

The thing that surprises me is that I don't mind being bad at it. There's something freeing about attempting something you have no particular talent for, with no professional stake, no test to pass. The 200 words are 200 more than I had. The mountain is still there. I'm not climbing it. But I can look at it and appreciate its shape.

私はまだ上手ではないです。でも、続けます。

(I am not yet good. But I will continue.)
