My first introduction to web development was my brother showing me how to use some WYSIWYG editor way back, must have been early 2000s and Dreamweaver maybe? Or FrontPage? Doesn’t really matter, I guess, anyway what my brother did was so amazing — he clicked on that button that took you behind the scenes and showed you the code. It looked like nothing to me but my brother seemed to actually understand what the wall of text meant, he changed something and I saw the difference in the browser. Magic.

I have no idea why he had this knowledge, he really wasn’t that interested in computers from what I can remember. I have a vague memory of him having a computer nerd friend from school (was his name Christian? Yeah, I think his name was Christian) so maybe it was from him.

Everything is kind of blurry after that, I don’t remember if my brother kept teaching me — I don’t think so? — but I know in 2004 I had a blog.
